Daydream delusion.　　
 Limousine Eyelash　　
 Oh, baby with your pretty face　　
 Drop a tear in my wineglass　　
 Look at those big eyes　　
 See what you mean to me　　
 Sweet cakes and milkshakes　　
 I am a delusioned angel　　
 I am a fantasy parade.　　
 I want you to know what I think.　　
 Don't want you to guess anymore.　　
 You have no idea where I came from.　　
 We have no idea where we're going.　　
 Launched in life.　　
 Like branches in the river.　　
 Flowing downstream.　　
 Caught in the current.　　
 I'll carry you. You'll carry me.　　
 That's how it could be.　　
 Don't you know me　　
 Don't you know me by now.
